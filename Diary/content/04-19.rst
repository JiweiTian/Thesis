Making the model work
=====================

:date: 2016-04-19

The aim today is to figure out if the model works and if it doesn't work to figure out why. My strategy for this is to look for graphs with the control system dynamics and compare them to what my model produces. If they don't line up I have a problem. 

Figure 7.13 (p96) fits the bills. It gives an input sequence I can approximate as well as the values for :math:`\Theta`, :math:`q` and :math:`dM`. After building the input sequence and simulating I'm in for a let down. The speed of the model looks good but the gain is waaaaaaay off. 

Looking for the mistake
-----------------------

Our ``PitchModel``'s transfer function is: 

.. math::

    G(s) = \frac{0.4323}{s + 1.33}

The thesis provides their guess for an estimated model as: 

.. math::

    G_n(s) = \frac{0.423}{s + 1.33}

They are more or less the same. The difference can probably be explained away because of the imprecise estimate of :math:`I_{yy}` I used. 

I have no idea what the mixer should look like but I assume that the PID/PD controllers are good. 

Maybe I can reverse engineer a value for the mixer based off the gains ? Of Course I can't ! The integrator ensures 0 SSE ! 

I have to give up for today. I'm just too tired to think straight. The product of todays work will have to stay at some code, a half baked simulink model and some shitty ideas. 

Better luck next time.
