Chosing a reference model
*************************

The requirements are :math:`T_s < 1s` and :math:`S_\% < 25\%`. The overshoot requirement imposes :math:`\zeta < 0.4` whilst the settling time can be approximated with (cf: previous post): 

.. math::
    
    T_s \approx \frac{5}{\zeta\omega_n} = \frac{12.5}{\omega_n}

Thus the required bandwidth is: 

.. math::

    \omega_n = \frac{12.5}{T_s} = 12.5 \quad rad/s

The corresponding second order model is obtained with:  

.. code-block:: matlab

    [num, den] = ord2(12.5, 0.4);
    RefModel = tf(num, den);

.. math:: 

    M_R = \frac{1}{s^2 + 10s + 156.2}

Model Performance. 

Unfortunately this is it for today. MATLAB has crashed and I'm done !
