Making some progress ?
======================

:date: 2016-04-26

Very little work this morning. My phone is breaking down and I spent most of my morning looking for replacement parts. 

This afternoon after the usual struggle with MATLAB hogging up to much memory I got to work. Discovered that there doesn't seem to be a documented way of running ``mlx`` files from the command window. The usual ``run script-name`` doesn't work. 

The objective today is to build a script to compare the results of the MATLAB and Simulink models so that I will know when they match up. 

Discoveries of the day:

#. The controllers in figure 7.1 (p83) are mis-labelled. The outer controller is the PID whilst the inner is the PD. This confirms my gut feeling.
#. I still don't know shit. 
   
Something really weird is going on ... The Pitch Rate plot looks waaaaaay to much like the expected Pitch Angle model. Why ??

I have no idea.

Corrections:
------------

Looking back on this all my conclusions were wrong. The controllers were not mislabelled but their parameters in the table were. I have no idea what was going on with the plot. Blame it on a forgotten ``clear all``.
